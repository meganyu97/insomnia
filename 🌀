every time i close my eyes it is the 
slamming of the prison cell doors and wake-up call for the terrorists to come out and play. 
they come out with a vendetta
riddled with dialogues of an adolescence passed over
only seen from an airplane window.
an airplane i was a hostage in, 
headed straight for the twin towers holding my body up.
rest is on the other side of a suspension bridge
held together by the beams of trust i give to people, 
always shredded into splinters
and the ropes i use to tie my nooses.
i never liked heights
when i look down i see what i always imagine everyone saw when they thought of me
but to look down one must somehow rise above
and in the midst of holding my head up in a world keen on designing things
with the sole purpose of weighing me down
i developed the muscle strength to climb up 
this giving tree ive planted
and looking down i see the branches that have snapped,
the remnants of the leaves that change colors every time i fall in love
i look down and see the people who have walked out of my life
and walk all over my leaves
for the sole pleasure of hearing them crunch under the weight of their words.
they ask me why i give so much in a world
that's taken so much from me
i give so that my tree can grow a new branch
to see the sun for the first time
because it often gets hard to see light from the forest unless it's through cinder eyes
it is in climbing that i maintain the strength in my legs to hold me up from the terrorism
raining embers in the forest i've planted 
and tended to since they were saplings.
i look down at the corpses of my collapsed giving trees,
cored from the inside out and turned into paper so that the people who have left me
can write their next love letters.
the susurrus of my forest carries the last whispers of smoke
from the graveyard of my darkest memories, but i look up
and still i rise.
